Remaining Ascena brands include Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant. \"We have a portfolio of strong brands, three of which individually generate revenue of approximately $1 billion or more,\" Teffner said. Ascena reported reported a quarterly loss, revenue that was slightly down from last year and flat same-store sales. Ascena stock has lost more than 92% of its value over the last year.

            "<p>Shares of Nio Inc.  slipped 0.3% in morning trading Friday, after Goldman Sachs analyst Fei Fang backed away from his bullish stance on the China-based electric car maker, citing concerns over sales volumes and potential share dilution. The stock has had a volatile start Friday, as it has traded down as much as 4.9% and up as much as 3.0% intraday. Fang cut his rating to neutral, after being at buy for the past seven months, while slashing his stock price target by 85%, to $1.47 from $9.76. While Nio's sales volumes have outperformed U.S. rival Tesla Inc.  and BYD Tang since China's government cut electric-vehicle (EV) subsidies in June, Nio's third-quarter guidance implies a 423-unit, month-on-month decline in volume in September, and the fourth-quarter outlook remains \"clouded.\" And given the outlook for continued negative free cash flow, Nio's funding pattern suggests a preference for continued use of equity, which would result in significant share count dilution,\" Fang wrote. The stock has soared 24% since closing at a record low of $1.32 on Oct. 1,which followed a 57% plunge amid an 8-session losing streak. The stock has shed 74% year to date, while Tesla's stock has dropped 31% and the S&P 500  has gained 17%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

UBS bumped up its price target to $390 from $305. \"Truly's stellar growth in fiscal 2019 failed to translate into meaningful earnings growth year-to-date as the company's heavy reliance on co-packers weighed on margins,\" analyst Sean King wrote. \"We now believe that this headwind will ease into fiscal 2020 with greater internal capacity coming. The extent of vertical integration and outlook for Truly growth will be key determinants of earnings growth for Boston Beer in fiscal 2020.\" Moreover, UBS has heard chatter about an ongoing shortage in White Claw, a big Truly competitor, which King thinks will drive share stabilization at Boston Beer.

The survey found that trendy items and denim will be among the top selections, with brands like American Eagle Outfitters Inc. , Guess Inc. , and G-III Apparel Group Ltd.  brands like Calvin Klein and DKNY among those that analysts think will benefit. With the focus on \"fashion\" apparel, B. Riley says Under Armour Inc.   could be hurt. And with shoppers more cautious about spending on clothes, B.

            "<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak ended his bearish call on Snap Inc.'s stock  Friday, upgrading the shares to equal-weight from underweight on signs of improvement in the company's advertising products and go-to-market strategy. \"At a high level, year-to-date we have underestimated Snap's stronger top- and bottom-line execution and ability to drive growth and upward revisions,\" Nowak wrote, as Snap's stock has risen 160% in 2019. His conversations with industry players and ad agencies suggest that Snap's new products are making markers more knowledgeable about how to place spots on Snap's platform. He also sees room for the company to improve its monetization, with Snap's average revenue per user currently languishing at a fifth of what Twitter Inc.  brings in and at 1/14th of what Facebook Inc.  can generate. Nowak boosted his target price to $17 from $14. Snap's stock took a fall in Thursday trading after Facebook's Instagram announced Threads, a new camera app for users' close friends.

            "<p>The U.S. trade deficit widened 1.6% in August to $54.9 billion, the Commerce Department said Friday. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected a deficit of $54.4 billion. Both import and exports increased, but imports rose at a faster pace. August exports of autos and auto parts were the highest since July 2014. Imports of consumer goods were the highest on record. Year-to-date, the U.S. is running a $428.7 billion deficit, up from $400 billion over the same period last year. Economists expect the trade gap will be a slight drag on third quarter growth. The U.S. trade deficit with China narrowed 3.1% to $31.8 billion in September.  \n",

            "<p>Activision Blizzard Inc. shares  are rising again in premarket trading Friday after the company announced that \"Call of Duty: Mobile\" has racked up more than 35 million downloads since its launch earlier this week. Activision President Rob Kostich said in a release that the game was \"on its way to becoming the #1 ranked iOS app in downloads overall, not only among games, but also among all apps, in 100 countries.\" Shares of the videogame publisher climbed 3.5% in Thursday trading after analysts weighed in on third-party download data. \"While it's too early to gauge the longevity of any contribution, the early results are a positive indication of consumer willingness to engage with the game and spend money,\" wrote Jefferies analyst Alex Giaimo. \"We believe the early success of 'CoD Mobile' provides additional cushion to Activision's 4Q guide, helping to mitigate reliance on 'Modern Warfare' and investor concern around Activision's 2Q comments of a 'wider range of possible outcomes' in 2H19.\" On Wednesday, however, Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger downgraded the stock, warning of \"too much hope\" around the company's 2019 slate and future releases. The shares are up 11% over the past three months, while the S&P 500  has lost 2.8%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The New Brunswick, N.J.-based drug company said it will dedicate a team of researchers to leverage its scientific resources to accelerate the discovery of next-generation medicines and vaccines to complement current investments by governments. The company's Janssen Pharmaceutical Cos. unit has eight HIV medicines on the market. About 37 million people are currently infected with HIV and about two million are newly infected every year, it said. Janssen will work to develop an investigational mosaic-based vaccine regimen to prevent HIV with a group of partners. The company will also work to help fully eliminate TB as part of a United Nations initiative that aims to eradicate TB by 2030.
