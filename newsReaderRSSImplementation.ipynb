Morgan turned bullish on the aluminum sheet company following the sharp pullback over the past couple weeks.

The stock has tumbled 10% through Friday since closing at a 1 1/2-year high on Sept. 18. Seifman said he likes the \"self-help opportunity\" following the recent pullback, with margin expansion potential and given current management's approach to new investment. \"After years of purgatory, we see Arconic moving toward a viable steady state as two companies and with dependable execution, ease should see investor attention,\" Seifman wrote in a note to clients.

Deutsche Bank analyst Kunal Madhukar moved his rating on the stock to buy from hold, writing that recent headlines shouldn't affect the company's financials. \"Despite a strong quarter and the raise that came with it, Match shares have virtually been in free fall since the company reported 2Q results,\" he wrote. \"In our view, while there is potential for near-term trading dislocation and the specter of increased supply once IAC  decides to spin off Match (where a decision could be announced shortly, and the process could take six to nine months), we think the overreaction to Facebook  Dating coming to the US or the FTC lawsuit against Match.com is exactly that - an overreaction.\" Madhukar thinks that Match might be in an even stronger position now that it's offering more payment flexibility to Android users. Instinet's Mark Kelley also upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, arguing that the company's emerging brands aren't getting enough credit from investors. He also sees the potential for margin improvement stemming from the Android payments move.

The analysts assigned the stock a price target of $31 that is more than double its current price of $14.72. The addressable market for straightening teeth is significant, said the note with less than 1% of the company's target market receiving care and a multi-year runway for growth. \"We see a clear path to sustained top-line growth at an almost 50% 2018-23 CAGR, which we view as conservative,\" said the note. Stifel agreed that there is demand for the product, although it took a more cautious stance. \"To be clear, our checks among consumers identified areas of dissatisfaction, as customer service and lack of Doctor oversight were issues for a subset of respondents,\" said Stifel analyst Jonathan Block. \"That said, we saw relatively solid ratings for the overall SDC experience despite these shortcomings, as a straighter smile and whiter teeth at a $2,000 price point seemingly resonated with the majority of the company's customers.\" On Friday, short seller Hindenburg Research said it estimates that the stock has about 85% downside in a damning note outlining practices that are illegal and endanger patients. \"Financially, the company is another profitless, cash incinerating 'unicorn' that we believe has significant added financial headwinds to face as a result of regulatory, legal and customer satisfaction liabilities,\" Hindenburg Founder Nathan Anderson wrote in the report. SmileDirect responded with a statement that hit out at \"organized dentistry.\" \"There is no factual basis nor scientific or medical justification in these allegations to substantiate the false claims made about our model and the state-licensed doctors in our affiliated network,\" the company said.

            "<p>Shares of General Electric Co.  surged 2.6% in premarket trading Monday, after the industrial conglomerate said it was freezing the U.S. pension plan for about 20,000 employees with salaried benefits, and supplementary pension benefits for 700 employees. GE said there would be no change for retirees already collecting pension benefits; the pension plan has been closed to new entrants since 2012. The company said it will offer a limited-time lump-sum payment option to about 100,000 former employees who have not yet started their monthly pension plan payments. GE said it is pre-funding approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of minimum ERISA [Employee Retirement Income Security Act] funding requirements for 2021 and 2022. GE said the pension moves was part of its plan that is expected to reduce its pension deficit by $5 billion to $8 billion and net debt by $4 billion to $6 billion. GE's stock has tumbled 32.4% over the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 0.5%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

            "<p>Ascena Retail Group Inc.'s  Interim Executive Chair Carrie Teffner used the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call to reaffirm that the company won't be filing Chapter 11 like so many other retailers recently. \"The company continues to consider options to optimize its balance sheet and liquidity from a position of strength,\" she said on the call, according to a FactSet transcript. \"[T]o be clear and for the avoidance of doubt, bankruptcy of Ascena is not one of the options being evaluated.\" Ascena is in the process of winding down its Dressbarn business, which should see all of its stores closed in December. And Ascena has divested the Maurices business, a $300 million deal with OpCapita LLP announced in March. Remaining Ascena brands include Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant. \"We have a portfolio of strong brands, three of which individually generate revenue of approximately $1 billion or more,\" Teffner said. Ascena reported reported a quarterly loss, revenue that was slightly down from last year and flat same-store sales. Ascena stock has lost more than 92% of its value over the last year. The stock was trading at 32 cents Friday afternoon. The S&P 500 index  is up 1.5% in the last 12 months.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The central bank moved into the spotlight after the overnight repo rate, or how much hedge funds and banks have to pay for short-term borrowing, rose so high that the Fed's benchmark interest rate pushed above its target range.
