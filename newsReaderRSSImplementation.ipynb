            "<p>GoPro Inc.  shares plunged nearly 20% in extended trading Wednesday after it announced a delay in shipments of some of its new cameras. Chief Executive Nick Woodman in a conference call with analysts late Wednesday said production delays will push back availability of the cameras until the fourth quarter instead of the third quarter as originally planned. The delay prompted GoPro to reduce its second-half revenue estimate range to $680 million to $715 million, or growth of about 7% to 9% year-over-year. Previously, it had forecast second-half growth of 9% to 12%. On Tuesday, the Silicon Valley company announced its HERO8 camera series to uniformly positive reviews.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

            "<p>E-Trade Financial Corporation  on Wednesday said it would eliminate retail commissions for online trades of U.S.-listed stocks, options and exchange-traded funds. The move comes after online brokerage rival Charles Schwab Corp.  on Tuesday dropped commissions on U.S. stocks, ETFs and options, a move that was followed by TD Ameritrade . E-Trade said it would also reduce its options contract charge to 65 cents per contract for all traders, while maintaining its active trader pricing at 50 cents per contract. The changes will take effect Oct. 7. The company said it estimated the impact of the commission changes on second-quarter operating results would have been around $75 million. Shares of online brokers have sold off sharply since the Schwab move. E-Trade shares are down 19.4% over the last two sessions, while Ameritrade has fallen 28.2% and Schwab has retreated 12.7% over the same stretch.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the Silicon Valley car maker to sell about 99,000 vehicles, including 80,200 Model 3s, Tesla's mass-market vehicle. Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles in the third quarter of 2018. The company said it achieved \"record\" net orders in the third quarter, and is seeing an increase in its order backlog in the current quarter. Nearly all of its Model 3 orders came from people who did not hold a reservation, \"solidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand,\" Tesla said. \"We are continuing to focus on increasing production to meet that demand,\" it said. The delivery number should be viewed as \"slightly conservative\" as the company only counts a vehicle as sold after all paperwork has gone through, it said. Shares of Tesla were 3.6% lower in the after-hours session after ending the regular trading day down 2%. Earlier Wednesday General Motors Co.  reported third-quarter sales that rose 6.3% compared with the third quarter of 2018. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

            "<p>U.S. stocks on Wednesday posted another round of sharp losses in only the second session in October, sparked by a private-sector employment report that reflected a weakening domestic labor market. Automatic Data Processing's weaker-than-expected payrolls figures, combined with the weakest manufacturing report from the Institute of Supply Management on Monday, have intensified anxieties about a creeping economic slowdown that is washing up on U.S. shores. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell about 1.9%, the S&P 500 index  declined 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite index  retreated  1.6%, based on preliminary levels. All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 fell for consecutive days for the first time since December of 2018. Payroll firm ADP said that 135,000 private-sector jobs were created in September, below expectations and marking a significant decline in the pace of job growth. Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. crude oil inventories rose for the third week in a row, compounding fears of a slowing global economy and sending energy stocks down 2.6% on the day. Auto stocks were also hit hard after Ford Motor Co.  reported vehicle sales fell 5.1% in the third quarter. Home builder stocks fared better than the broader market after Lennar Corp.  reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF  fell about 0.7% on the day.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

He doubts that shooter titles have the same reliable-growth prospects as other titles, such as Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.'s  \"Grand Theft Auto.\" He's also skeptical that early signs of traction for \"Call of Duty\" mobile and \"World of Warcraft Classic\" will translate into positive enough financials to justify a big run up in Actvision's enterprise value recently. Finally, he sees \"troubling signs\" on \"Black Ops 5\" developments and tough comparisons going forward. \"As for the rest of the pipeline, lest we forget, of the three very successful launches from 2014 to 2016, one is dead ('Destiny') and we believe the other two are seriously ill ('Overwatch,' 'Hearthstone').\" He bumped his target price up slightly to $43 from $41 in conjunction with the downgrade.

            "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday was shedding more than 1%, adding to an ugly start to October, and pushing the blue-chip gauge below a closely watched trend line, after a private-sector jobs report came in weaker than expected, sparking fresh fears of a domestic slowdown or outright recession. The Dow  most recently was down 300 points, or 1.1%, at 26,270, trading below its 50-day moving average at 26,540.29, according to FactSet data. The index hasn't finished below its short-term average since Sept. 4. A breach of that level, viewed by technical analysts as a demarcation line between bullish and bearish trends, could add pressure to stock selling, with such technical moves tending to trigger sell signals among computer and algorithmic traders. A private-sector employment report released early Wednesday from Automatic Data Processing  showed that a modest 135,000 jobs were created in September, another sign that hiring is slowing along with the broader U.S. economy. That missed the Econoday consensus forecast of 152,000 jobs. On top of that, the average monthly job growth for the past three months also fell to 145,000 from 214,000 for the same time period last year. The weak employment reading comes ahead of the more closely followed non-farm payrolls report due on Friday and after the weakest reading of manufacturing activity from the Institute of Supply Management in about a decade. The broader market also was under selling pressure, with the S&P 500 index  down 1.1% at 2,907, after finishing below its own 50-day moving average on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 1.1% at 7,822, while the small-capitalization Russell 2000 index  was trading 1.4% lower at 1,472. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

            "<p>Johnson & Johnson's stock  rallied 2.3% in morning trading Wednesday, and was the only gainer among the Dow Jones Industrial Average's  30 components, after drug maker announced a settlement with two Ohio counties ahead of an upcoming opioid trial. Under terms of the settlement, J&J will pay a combined $10 million to the Cuyahoga and Summit counties, will reimburse $5 million of the counties' legal and other expenses and direct $5.4 million in charitable contributions to organizations in connection with opioid-related programs in the counties. J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Schott said he viewed the settlement as \"an incremental positive\" as it came in below investor expectations, and helps J&J avoid further near-term opioid headlines. Schott reiterated his neutral rating, however, as he still sees a \"long path ahead\" for opioid litigation. The stock has gained 3.0% year to date, while the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF  has tacked on 2.3% and the Dow has advanced 12.6%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

            "<p>Boeing Co. shares  fell 1.3% Wednesday, after a New York Times report said a senior engineer had filed an internal ethics complaint this year over the company's decision to reject a safety system for the 737 Max on cost grounds that he believed could have reduced risks tied to two fatal crashes. Boeing has handed the complaint over to the Justice Department, which is conducting a criminal probe of the design of the aircraft, the paper reported, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. At least one former Boeing worker has been questioned by federal investigators about the allegations, according to another person cited by the paper. The paper said the engineer who filed the complaint called out the chief executive for misrepresenting the safety of the plane. Boeing shares have fallen 4% in the last 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has fallen about 2%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
