# bdai_notebooks
Throw all your ad-hoc analysis, Jupyter notebooks, R scripts, all that junk in here.  General naming convention should be capital case with no spaces, e.g. MyJupyterNotebook.ipynb or JankyRScript.R

The "python" folder is for storing Python scripts and notebooks, "r" is for R scripts.  Go nuts.
